### What classes should I take as a freshman?

First, determine what classes you need to graduate. Consider what, if any, can be waived by transfer credit. From the remaining classes, choose a subset that optimize the following:

1. **Most important first.** If you have specific goals, such as getting an internship, this will allow you to prioritise certain classes over others. Even if you're unsure, it is safe to defer non-essential classes: for example, there is no need to take EE 16A your first semester.
2. **Most introductory first.** It's easier to follow a prereq chain upwards rather than backwards. Consider soft-prereqs, as in certain _skills_ you'd be better off knowing before you start taking a class and remember that since prereqs are not enforced, the particular classes you take to gain prereq knowledge for other classes don't matter (unless they are in themselves required).
3. **Prefer synergistic courses combinations.** An example is taking math and physics at the same time if the physics class uses concepts from the math class. It's easier to think about how the same concept applies to two courses if you're taking them concurrently.

Your choice will be subject to these constraints:

- **Limited number of seats in a class.** You will get more enrollment priority with more semesters taken at Cal. To know if a class is likely to fill up, see [historical enrollment data on BerkeleyTime](https://berkeleytime.com/enrollment). This is also how you tell whether you need to phase 1 a class.
- **Maximum units in a semester.** You get 20.5 units in a semester unless you get it raised by an L&S advisor (if you're undeclared L&S) or by the CS department (see the bottom of [this page](https://eecs.berkeley.edu/resources/undergrads/cs/major-declaration-appeal)).
- **Minimum units in a semester.** You need to have at least 13 units in L&S or 12 units in CoE. There are exceptions if you're working or in DSP. You can safely late drop below 13 units, but you can only do that once. If you don't have at least 12 units, bad things can happen with FA and other stuff.
- **Scheduling.** Some course combinations will be impossible based on a given semester's schedule if they have mandatory sections that overlap (confirm that it's really mandatory). Some course combinations will be uncomfortable (early morning, schedule-gaps, overlap with meal times), but this should only be a secondary concern. It's inadvisable to base your class selection on making schedule planner look nice.
- **Workload (effort).** Overworking yourself with classes is a poor use of your effort. You'll have a better idea of a course's workload (and whether it interests you) once you start taking it, so use the period up to the add/drop deadline strategically. It's best to start out with more classes than you think you can handle since it's easier to drop classes than add them once they start (you don't want to play catch-up). You can attempt to balance your workload by spreading out breadth classes over your semesters, but this is not very important.
- **Workload (time).** Time is secondary to effort. You may think your time is constrained, but rarely is this actually the case. You only need to worry about time constraints if you're taking classes that involve a lot of busy-work. This factor is more important if you're doing other time-sucking activities like working or certain clubs.
- **Pass/No-Pass Grading Option.** You can only have 1/3 of your units be PNP (unless you have more than 120 units) and must take at least 1 graded course per semeseter (you will be placed on academic probation if not). PNP makes classes much easier because you only have to do C-quality work. The PNP deadline is much later than the add/drop deadline, so it can be used as a softer form of droping a course. PNP courses typically cannot count for major requirements.

#### But should I take (tech) course X and (tech) course Y together?

If you're concerned about workload, start doing the courses before the semester starts, if possible. Many courses have resources online.

#### But how many units should I take?

The number of units you take doesn't matter as long as you have at least the minimum. Be concerned about workload, not units.

### I want a PhD in Computer Science

No, you probably don't. But read these:

### In L&S, want to add a CoE major or transfer to CoE.
