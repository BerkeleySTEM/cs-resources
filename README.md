### What classes should I take as a freshman?

First, determine what classes you need to graduate. Consider what, if any, can be waived by transfer credit. From the remaining classes, choose a subset that optimize the following:

1. **Most important first.** If you have specific goals, such as getting an internship, this will allow you to prioritise certain classes over others. Even if you're unsure, it is safe to defer non-essential classes: for example, there is no need to take EE 16A your first semester.
2. **Most introductory first.** It's easier to follow a prereq chain upwards rather than backwards. Consider soft-prereqs, as in certain _skills_ you'd be better off knowing before you start taking a class and remember that since prereqs are not enforced, the particular classes you take to gain prereq knowledge for other classes don't matter (unless they are in themselves required).
3. **Prefer synergistic courses combinations.** An example is taking math and physics at the same time because the physics class will use concepts from the math class.

Your choice will be subject to these constraints:

- **Enrollment caps.** You will get more enrollment priority with more semesters taken at Cal.
- **Unit cap.** You get 20.5 units in a semester unless you get it raised by an L&S advisor (if you're undeclared L&S).
- **Unit minimum.** You need to have at least 13 units in L&S or 12 units in CoE. There are exceptions for people who work and DSP. You can safely one-time-drop below 13 units, but you can only do that once. If you don't meet the minimum, bad things will happen with FA and other stuff.
- **Scheduling.** Some course combinations will be impossible based on a given semester's schedule. Some course combinations will be uncomfortable (8AM, schedule-gaps, overlap with meal times), but this should only be a secondary concern. It's inadvisable to base your class selection on making schedule planner look nice.
- **Workload (effort).** Overworking yourself with classes is a poor use of your effort. You'll have a better idea of a course's workload once you start taking it, so use the period up to the add/drop deadline intelligently. It's easier to drop classes than add them once they start (you don't want to play catch-up) so starting out overly ambitious isn't a terrible idea. You can be strategic about workload by spreading out breadth classes over your semesters.
- **Workload (time).** Time is secondary to effort. You may think your time is constrained, but rarely is this actually the case. You only need to worry about time constraints if you're taking classes that involve, essentially, busy-work. This factor is more important if you're doing other time-sucking activities like working or certain clubs.
- **Pass/No-Pass Grading Option.** You can only have 1/3 of your units be PNP and must take at least 1 graded course per semeseter (you will be placed on academic probation if not). PNP makes classes much easier because you only have to do C-quality work. The PNP deadline is much later than the add/drop deadline, so it can be used as a softer form of droping a course. PNP courses typically cannot count for major requirements.

#### But should I take (tech) course X and (tech) course Y together?

If you're concerned about workload, start doing the courses before the semester starts, if possible. Many courses have resources online.

#### But how many units should I take?

The number of units you take doesn't matter as long as you have at least the minimum. Be concerned about workload, not units.

### I want a PhD in Computer Science

No, you probably don't. But read these:
